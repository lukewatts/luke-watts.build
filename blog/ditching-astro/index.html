			<p><strong>UPDATE: Sep 12th 2022:</strong> As of today the Astro team have deployed a fix! So I'll get started on the new Astro build soon hopefully</p>

			<p>In my first post I mentioned I had used Astro to generate the static pages for this site. All was quite going well, initially, and I actually (still) really like Astro. However, that was back in v1.1.3 (or something), and there were still a few quirks around using Tailwind which meant I ended up ditching the Astro build step and just continuing with the static files.</p>

			<h2>What went wrong?</h2>
			<p>Essentially, when I create a <code>global.css</code> with my base Tailwind styles...</p> 
			
			<pre>@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;</pre>

			<p>They would work fine on the development build, but once a production build would happen the global.css would end up second or last in the order inserted into the head.</p>
			<p>At this time, I'm unable to get around it, so I've just had to revert to using the static build and fixing the order manually and continuing with the static files.</p>
			<p>Hopefully this will be fixed in a future version of Astro, and I can go back to using it.</p>
			<p>I've logged it with the Astro team as a bug so you can read more about the issue there: <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/4614">Issue #4614</a></p>
			<p>Once it get's fixed I'll most likely resume using Astro once I have time to update it</p>
