				<p>I&#39;m back! I&#39;ve been wanting to re-launch my blog for a long time now, and so when I heard about <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> I knew it was time.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still working on some things, but I&#39;m happy with the progress so far. As I mentioned, I&#39;m using Astro, which is a new static site generator that uses React components (or Vue, Svelte, Alpine etc). I&#39;m also using Tailwind CSS for styling. I&#39;ll probably use AlpineJS as well, because I really like it! Goes really well with React and Tailwind. So for now I&#39;m just using the default blog template from Astro CLI, but I will be redesigning the site from the ground up over the next few weeks.</p>
<h2 id="where-have-i-been">Where have I been?</h2>
<p>So I had a fairly popular blog back in 2014-2017. Popular enough that <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publshing</a> reached out to me to write a book in 2015. I wrote a book called <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/mastering-sass/9781785883361">Mastering Sass</a> which was published in August 2016. That was back when I worked for myself. I had started a small web design agency a few years before, and my blog was about new technologies I was learning so I (we/Affinity4) could compete in the market, and Sass (&amp; Compass) was one of them.</p>
<p>Then, in 2017 I took a job with the leading Telecommunications company in Ireland, <a href="https://three.ie">Three Ireland</a>. I stopped blogging and accidentally let my domain expire for a week, in which time some Chinese scammer bought it and filled created a ad-filled garbage pile of a website. After a few years I guess they got bored of it and I managed to buy the domain again last at the start of the pandemic (2019). I knew I needed to wait for the bad rep my domain had to die down before I could start blogging again. So I just left it offline since then.</p>
<h2 id="why-am-i-back">Why am I back?</h2>
<p>So while working with Three, I had a lot of life happen. I travelled a lot, got married, bought a house, and most recently started a new job as a Senior Developer with a successful startup called <a href="https://workvivo.com">Workvivo</a>.</p>
<p>So with that I&#39;m learning a lot of new things, and re-learning some forgotten things. So I thought it was time to start blogging again, and sharing what I&#39;m learning, like I used to do.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next?</h2>
<p>I&#39;m going to be writing about a lot of things, but I&#39;m going to try and focus on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m building a full-stack framework called <a href="https://github.com/noesis-framework/noesis">Noesis</a>, which uses InertiaJS, React, Tailwind, and my own PHP MVC framework called <a href="https://github.com/noesis-framework/dianoia">Dianoia</a>. I&#39;m going to be writing about that a lot.</li>
<li>Laravel</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>AlpineJS</li>
<li>AWS</li>
<li>And probably a bit about <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> as well, as I use it to rebuild this site, and maybe others, like the Noesis/Dianoia docs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So that&#39;s it for now. I&#39;m going to be writing a lot more, so stay tuned!</p>
