				<p>Hi! I’m Luke, a senior software engineer who works with Laravel and React mostly.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with computers since I was a teenager when I worked as an AutoCAD draughtsman with a local luxury carpet manufacturer.</p>
<p>I was always interested in web design, and when the recession hit in 2008, I was laid off and decided to go back to school to learn web design and development.</p>
<p>I first did a web design course with Dreamweaver, and the instructor said I (and a handful of others) should consider also doing a course in PHP and MySQL that was coming up a few months later. I was the only one who did, and I was hooked.</p>
<p>For the next 2 years, I taught myself PHP, Composer, Codeigniter, NPM, Gulp, and anything else I thought I would need to build a complete end-to-end web application.</p>
<p>In 2014 I started my own web development company, Affinity4, with one of my friends from that original Dreamweaver course. We would talk for hours about how we would be different from other web development companies in the area, and how we would be cutting-edge and use the latest technologies.</p>
<p>He handled the design, marketing, and SEO side of things, and I handled the code side. In the beginning, we mostly built WordPress sites for local businesses in Galway, Ireland, but I soon became bored with WordPress. I wanted to BUILD the cutting-edge web applications we had talked about building, but most of our clients were not interested in that. They wanted what they had seen. What they had seen was WordPress.</p>
<p>Around that time Laravel 3 was released and was taking the web development community by storm. I was hooked and quickly ditched Codeigniter in favor of it. Codeigniter was great for getting started, but it was not a framework I wanted to build a business on. Laravel was the framework I had been looking for.</p>
<p>I also started learning Backbone.js and AngularJS (v1 I think), but never really clicked with either of them. However, I knew I should learn a frontend framework to build the kind of applications I knew would set us apart from other agencies in Galway at the time. I came across Knockout.Js and React, and with those in my tool belt, I knew I could build anything a client might throw at me.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, a client finally walked through the door with a fully custom web application idea they had been struggling to get built. We took on the project, and I built the entire application, from server to front end, in Laravel and React for the next 6-8 months.</p>
<p>In mid-2018, I decided to look for work as a web developer with another company. I suffered burnout a few months earlier (I had been coding day and night since 2012 at this point), and because I couldn’t work, I was struggling to get new clients, and our business was too small to even take a week off, let alone the 2 or more that I probably needed to recharge.</p>
<p>Also, I had been developing on my own for 4 years, and I wanted to see what it was like to work with a team of developers. After months of applying for jobs, and interviewing, I had a few offers, but I was holding out for one company who I had interviewed with a few months earlier. They were a leading telecoms company in Ireland, Three Ireland, and I had a good feeling about them.</p>
<p>I got the job in 2015 and worked there for 5 years as a full-stack web developer. I learned a lot about working in a team, building large, data-intensive applications, and working with a large codebase.</p>
<p>I was still very happy there, even after 5 years, but I wanted to get back to working with Laravel and React, neither of which Three used at the time. Part of me also wanted to work for a startup and get some of that startup energy back into my life. I missed the excitement of building something from the ground up, and I missed the feeling of being part of a team that was building something new. The application I had worked on at Three was started in 2012, so all those decisions had already been made.</p>
<p>In mid-2022, almost exactly 5 years after starting with Three, I started a new job with a startup in Cork, Ireland called Workvivo. I’m currently a senior software engineer with them, and I’m working with Laravel and React again. The company started in 2017 and since I joined they have received their series B funding, and are growing fast. I’m excited to be part of the team, and I’m excited to see where we go from here.</p>
<p>Of course, coding isn’t all I do. Before I was into computers I wanted to be a comic book artist, and I’ve always kept my hand in drawing and painting. I’ve been using Photoshop since my AutoCAD days, and I mostly do digital painting with Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo now (the image above is one of mine). There’s a link to my Portfolio in the menu if you want to see some more of my work :)</p>
<p>I also love music (who doesn’t) and I have pretty diverse tastes. I was a heavy metal/death metal fan for most of my angsty teenage years, and I’m still a huge metal fan today, but I also listen to a lot of electronic, 80s pop, and Synthwave (new music which is heavily inspired by 80s pop and film music e.g. Blade Runner, Tron, Terminator, etc).</p>
<p>I also play guitar and some keyboard and create digital music with Ableton. I have some of my music on Spotify, Bandcamp, and Soundcloud. Everything from metal to Synthwave and ambient music.</p>
